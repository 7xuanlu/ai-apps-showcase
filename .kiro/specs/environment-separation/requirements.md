# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will establish proper environment separation for a Next.js application, configuring SQLite for development and Supabase for production, with automated deployment to Vercel through GitHub integration. This ensures a smooth development workflow while providing a scalable production database solution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use SQLite for local development, so that I can work offline and have fast database operations during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in development mode THEN the system SHALL use SQLite as the database
2. WHEN database migrations are run in development THEN the system SHALL apply them to the local SQLite database
3. WHEN the development server starts THEN the system SHALL automatically create the SQLite database if it doesn't exist
4. WHEN running database operations in development THEN the system SHALL not require internet connectivity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Supabase for production, so that I can have a managed PostgreSQL database with built-in authentication and real-time features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in production mode THEN the system SHALL use Supabase PostgreSQL as the database
2. WHEN database migrations are run in production THEN the system SHALL apply them to the Supabase database
3. WHEN the production application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to Supabase using secure credentials
4. IF Supabase connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fail gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configuration, so that database connections and other settings are automatically configured based on the deployment environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the NODE_ENV is "development" THEN the system SHALL load development-specific configuration
2. WHEN the NODE_ENV is "production" THEN the system SHALL load production-specific configuration
3. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which variables are required
4. WHEN switching between environments THEN the system SHALL automatically use the correct database configuration without manual intervention

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment to Vercel, so that my application is automatically deployed when I push changes to the main branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN Vercel SHALL automatically trigger a deployment
2. WHEN the deployment builds THEN the system SHALL use production environment variables from Vercel
3. WHEN the deployment completes successfully THEN the application SHALL be accessible via the Vercel URL
4. IF the deployment fails THEN Vercel SHALL provide detailed error logs and notifications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure credential management, so that sensitive database credentials and API keys are not exposed in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing database credentials THEN the system SHALL use environment variables only
2. WHEN committing code THEN sensitive credentials SHALL NOT be included in the repository
3. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN production credentials SHALL be configured in Vercel's environment variables
4. WHEN running locally THEN development credentials SHALL be loaded from .env.local file

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database schema synchronization, so that both development and production databases have consistent schema definitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database schema changes are made THEN the same schema SHALL be applicable to both SQLite and PostgreSQL
2. WHEN running migrations THEN the system SHALL support both database types with the same migration files
3. WHEN deploying to production THEN database migrations SHALL be automatically applied
4. IF schema incompatibilities exist THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and migration guidance
